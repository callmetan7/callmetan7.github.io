# Creating a DIY Taser
---
Why do this? For fun. Moving on.

## Materials
1. Pulse Transformer

2. 2 20kV capacitors

3. 2 AA batteries
---

## Procedure

1. Connect the two AA batteries in series

2. Join the 20kV capacitors in series

3. Connect everything together. Attach the battery bank to the pulse transformer input channels and connect the capacitors to the end terminals

4. Do not use this on anyone. Simply enjoy the arching of electrcity with your eyes. 

## Other Notes
---
- Take note of the wires you use at the end terminals where the arching occurs. There is a possibility that you may be using wires that cannot sustain such high voltages and they will burn
- Be careful of touching your taser after it has been recently turned on, the residual charge can still shock you enough to burn you slightly (Trust me, I would know)
